## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!-- The ability to participate in an online community from a young age inspired myself to see the best in -->
I grew up chronically online, making the majority of my friends on Minecraft and Roblox. 

Nowadays, the games built for the good of the players have been pushed down by algorithms and have been replaced by cash grabs and dopamine factories. Games curated to hold the attention span of kids through addictive gameplay (RNG/gambling, bright colors,)... Seeing the current environment of Roblox games has me concerned for the damage dealt to this generation's kids' brains.
<!--Currently, I'm a student at UIC (ideally) looking to get into the video game production industry. C++ is my strong suit but I'm also learning Luau on the side
in preparation for making one of my first games!-->

In the near future, I'd like to finish my project, [Food Fight Defense](https://github.com/jignacio1299/Food-Fight-Defense). This game is my attempt to emulate the kinds of games from my childhood--ones that actually cares for its players. The experience so far has, in me, developed a newfound appreciation for all the work that goes on behind the scenes. I would love to be invited onto other similar projects when I have the time!
