## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Growing up, I was always glued to my computer screen, making friends with people online on Minecraft servers and Roblox games. Looking back on it, I think that participating in a gaming community is an experience that defined a lot of my current personality today. My previous experiences with games has helped me grow as a person; it nurtured an aspect of curiosity and learning that schools typically stamp out with boring textbooks and assignments; it taught me how to explore paths to success myself, instead of following what my parents and school tell me will make me successful.

Nowadays, the games built for the good of the players have been pushed down by algorithms and have been replaced by cash grabs and dopamine factories. Games curated to hold the attention span of kids through addictive gameplay (RNG/gambling, bright colors,)... Seeing the current environment of Roblox games has me concerned for the damage dealt to this generation's kids' brains. I think that games should serve to get a child to critically think and socialize with their close family/friends, not try to syphon money out of them.

In the near future, I'd like to finish my project, [Food Fight Defense](https://github.com/jignacio1299/Food-Fight-Defense). This game is my attempt to emulate the kinds of games from my childhood--ones that actually cares for its players. The experience so far has, in me, developed a newfound appreciation for all the work that goes on behind the scenes. I would love to be invited onto other similar projects when I have the time!
